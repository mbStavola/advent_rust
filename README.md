# advent_rust
I've been *super* interested in Rust for a while, but I haven't actually programmed in it very much.

I figured doing the Advent of Code would be some nice, easy practice to stretch my rusty legs (I couldn't help it).

The solutions work, but most likely aren't optimal or idiomatic so don't try to learn from this!
